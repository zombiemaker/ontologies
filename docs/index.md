## Overview

I like abstract and metaphysical thinking.  Because of that, I have discovered that I enjoy creating digital ontology models of the wonderful universe that the Lord has made.

I have created a number of onotology models for different domains that I have interests in.  I create them as a by-product of my efforts to understand the universe and how different aspects and elements in and beyond creation related to one another.

I share my work with everyone in hopes that it helps us better understand the universe together and better communicate with one another.
